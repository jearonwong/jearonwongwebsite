      "AI Agent Lifecycle is the work-continuity layer for agent systems: intent, context, role, plan, confirmation, execution, evidence, learning, and accepted outcome.",
    definition:
      "AI Agent Lifecycle is the discipline of keeping agent work continuous from human intent to accepted outcome. It treats intent, context, role, plan, confirmation, execution, evidence, learning, and closure as lifecycle state rather than loose prompt text or runtime exhaust. A lifecycle view asks whether a system can preserve the meaning of the work across sessions, tools, agents, reviews, and changes, not merely whether a single execution succeeded.",
    problem:
      "The problem it names is the gap between runnable agents and accountable work. An agent can produce a correct-looking output while losing the reason the work was requested, the constraints that made it acceptable, the authority boundary around the action, or the evidence needed for review. That failure is especially visible when work crosses multiple conversations, handoffs, agents, or tools. The project continues, but the agent system may only see the latest slice of text.",
    whyExistingApproachesAreNotEnough:
      "Prompt engineering can make one request clearer. Context engineering can improve what the model sees. Orchestration can make execution repeatable. Observability can record what happened. None of those alone defines what must remain valid before, during, and after execution. A lifecycle needs a grammar for continuity: what state is active, what has expired, what has been confirmed, which evidence is required, and when an outcome is accepted.",
    relationToLifecycle:
      "AI Agent Lifecycle is the category that sits beneath Agentic Delivery and above isolated execution. Agentic Delivery names the shift from task execution to reliable project delivery; AI Agent Lifecycle explains what has to stay continuous for that shift to be real. MPLP is one proof surface for expressing this lifecycle as protocol vocabulary, while Cognitive OS, SoloCrew, and Validation Lab explore runtime, product, and evidence surfaces.",
    evidenceRoute:
      "The evidence route starts with the origin essay, because it explains why the category grew out of real engineering failure boundaries. From there, the MPLP proof surface shows how lifecycle concepts can become protocol records, while Validation Lab keeps the delivery claim tied to inspectable evidence. The route is intentionally modest: it shows a thesis, a vocabulary, and proof surfaces, not market adoption.",

    definition:
      "Intent Drift is the gradual separation between the original human objective and the direction an agent system actually follows. The words in the current prompt may still look reasonable, but the work has moved away from the intended outcome, active constraints, or strategic judgment that gave the task meaning. Intent Drift is not only a model misunderstanding. It is a lifecycle failure where the system lacks a stable way to preserve, update, and verify intent over time.",
    problem:
      "The problem it names is quiet misalignment during long-running work. A user may begin with a clear objective, clarify several boundaries, reject certain paths, and approve a direction. After enough sessions, summaries, tool runs, and handoffs, the agent may continue with a plausible but altered interpretation. No single step looks obviously wrong. The drift appears when the final direction no longer matches the reason the work existed.",
    whyExistingApproachesAreNotEnough:
      "Better prompts reduce ambiguity at the moment of instruction, but they do not guarantee that intent survives change. Longer context windows can hold more material, but they do not decide which intent is current, which decisions are historical, and which constraints still bind execution. Logs can show actions after the fact, but they do not prove that each action stayed attached to the approved objective. Intent needs to be represented as active lifecycle state.",
    relationToLifecycle:
      "Within AI Agent Lifecycle, Intent Drift is one of the core failure modes the lifecycle is designed to detect and reduce. The lifecycle asks for a traceable path from intent to context, plan, confirmation, execution, evidence, review, and accepted outcome. If that path cannot be reconstructed, drift becomes invisible until a human notices the mismatch. Protocol Engineering makes the intent object explicit; Lifecycle Evidence makes the adherence inspectable.",
    evidenceRoute:
      "The evidence route for Intent Drift runs through the origin essay and the lifecycle governance essay. The origin essay names the experience of project intent shifting across prompts, summaries, and sessions. The governance essay then shows why intent needs a lifecycle authority layer rather than a one-time instruction. MPLP, Cognitive OS, and Validation Lab each test a different part of that route: protocol, runtime state, and evidence review.",

      "Context Drift is the loss of fit between the context an agent uses and the actual state of the work. It can happen when summaries compress away reasoning, old rules remain active after requirements change, abandoned paths re-enter the task, or important constraints are present but not weighted correctly. Context Drift is not simply a shortage of tokens. It is a failure to keep context valid, scoped, and connected to current lifecycle state.",
    problem:
      "The problem it names is that agent systems often treat context as a pile of relevant text. Real project context is more structured than that. It includes decisions, rejected options, active constraints, role boundaries, evidence expectations, unresolved risks, and acceptance criteria. When those pieces are flattened into notes or summaries, the agent may read more material while understanding less about what still matters now.",
    whyExistingApproachesAreNotEnough:
      "Retrieval, memory, and long-context models help agents access more information, but access is not the same as authority. A retrieved note may be outdated. A rule file may conflict with a newer decision. A summary may preserve a conclusion while losing the trade-off that made the conclusion valid. Without lifecycle semantics, the system has no reliable way to distinguish current context from stale context, background context, or nonbinding history.",
    relationToLifecycle:
      "AI Agent Lifecycle treats context as a stateful layer that must be loaded, updated, invalidated, and evidenced as work moves forward. Context Drift is closely tied to Intent Drift: once context stops representing the real project state, intent becomes easier to reinterpret incorrectly. Cognitive OS is the runtime proof surface for this concern, while Lifecycle Evidence and MPLP show why context needs traceable links to plans, confirmations, and outcomes.",
    evidenceRoute:
      "The evidence route for Context Drift starts in the origin essay's discussion of summaries, rule files, and stale project state. It continues through Cognitive OS as the runtime proof surface: the place where context has to become active state, not background reading. Validation Lab matters because context validity eventually has to be checked against evidence, especially when the same work resumes across sessions or agents.",

Delivery means carrying human intent through context, planning, confirmation, execution, evidence, review, and accepted outcome. It is a project-level concept, not a prompt-level compliment. An agent that can act is useful; an agent system that can deliver must preserve meaning, authority, and evidence across time.",
    problem:

In this site architecture, governance is not a policy banner placed around an agent after it runs. It is part of the lifecycle itself: who authorized the work, under which intent, with what constraints, through which plan, and against what evidence the result is accepted.",
    problem:
      "The problem it names is that agent autonomy can outrun accountability. A multi-agent system may coordinate tools, pass tasks between agents, and produce outputs while leaving unclear who approved an action, which scope was permitted, and what evidence proves the result stayed legitimate. Once consequential work crosses tools, agents, and time, informal human oversight is too fragile to serve as the only governance layer.",
    whyExistingApproachesAreNotEnough:
      "Access control, monitoring, and human-in-the-loop checkpoints each solve part of the governance problem. Access control says what a system can reach. Monitoring says what happened. Human review can approve or reject a proposed action. But agent governance also needs continuity across those pieces: authority must attach to intent, plans must carry constraints, confirmations must be recorded, and evidence must survive after execution.",
    relationToLifecycle:
      "AI Agent Lifecycle gives governance a place to live. Instead of treating governance as a separate compliance layer, the lifecycle binds governance to the path from intent to accepted outcome. Confirmation Boundary is one governance primitive. Lifecycle Evidence is another. Protocol Engineering makes those primitives explicit enough to be implemented across agent systems without claiming that one implementation has become universal.",
    evidenceRoute:
      "The evidence route for AI Agent Governance starts with the MCP/A2A lifecycle governance essay, because that essay separates tool access and agent coordination from lifecycle authority. From there, MPLP gives the protocol proof surface for context, plan, confirm, trace, and evidence. Validation Lab keeps the governance claim accountable by asking what records would let a reviewer inspect authorization, action, and outcome. This keeps governance practical: the question is not whether a page claims safety, but whether the system can show the authority path behind the work. That path is what makes governance inspectable after the agent has already acted and after memory has faded.",

    seoDescription:
      "Lifecycle Evidence is the inspectable proof chain that connects AI agent intent, plan, confirmation, execution, review, and accepted outcome.",
    definition:
      "Lifecycle Evidence is the inspectable proof chain that connects agent work from intent to accepted outcome. It includes the artifacts needed to reconstruct why the work began, what context was active, what plan was approved, which confirmations were required, what actions occurred, what changed, how the result was reviewed, and why the outcome was accepted or rejected. Evidence is not the same as raw logs. It is structured support for a delivery claim.",
    problem:
      "The problem it names is that many agent systems can say they completed work without showing enough evidence to trust the claim. A trace may show calls. A diff may show changes. A chat transcript may show discussion. But none of those alone proves that the result satisfied the original intent under the approved constraints. Without lifecycle evidence, reliability becomes a narrative rather than an inspectable condition.",
    whyExistingApproachesAreNotEnough:
      "Observability tools are valuable, but they often describe system behavior from the runtime outward. Lifecycle Evidence starts from the delivery claim and asks what must be visible for that claim to be assessed. Evaluations can test outputs, but they may not preserve authority, context, confirmation, or acceptance state. Audit logs can record events, but they may not explain whether the events were legitimate within the lifecycle.",
    relationToLifecycle:
      "AI Agent Lifecycle depends on evidence because continuity must be inspectable. If a system cannot show how intent became plan, how plan became confirmed action, and how action became an accepted outcome, the lifecycle is only implied. Validation Lab is the proof surface most directly tied to Lifecycle Evidence. MPLP supplies protocol vocabulary for evidence-bearing records, while Cognitive OS explores how runtime state can keep evidence attached to work.",
    evidenceRoute:
      "The evidence route is direct: start with the Agentic Delivery essay to understand why accepted outcome matters, then read the governance essay for the protocol gap above MCP and A2A. Validation Lab is the main proof surface because it treats evidence as something to inspect rather than something to assert. MPLP and Cognitive OS explain how evidence can be represented and kept attached to lifecycle state.",

      "A Confirmation Boundary defines where AI agent work must stop for explicit authorization before consequential execution continues.",
    definition:
      "A Confirmation Boundary is the point where an agent system must stop and obtain explicit authorization before consequential execution continues. The boundary is not a generic approval button. It defines what plan is being approved, which scope is covered, which actions remain outside the approval, who is authorizing the next step, and how that authorization links back to the original intent and active constraints.",
    problem:
      "The problem it names is the difference between permission and governable authorization. In many agent products, a human is asked to approve an action without seeing the full lifecycle context: why the action is necessary, what it changes, what evidence will prove completion, and when the agent must return for review. Approval becomes a momentary UI event instead of a durable governance record.",
    whyExistingApproachesAreNotEnough:
      "Human-in-the-loop design is necessary but often underspecified. A human can be present and still lack the information needed to authorize responsibly. Access controls can block categories of action, but they do not define when a specific plan is acceptable. Logs can show that approval happened, but not necessarily what was approved. A Confirmation Boundary makes the approved scope and its lifecycle links explicit.",
    relationToLifecycle:
      "Within AI Agent Lifecycle, Confirmation Boundary sits between plan and execution. It is one of the points where human authority enters the lifecycle in a structured way. Protocol Engineering can model the boundary as a record rather than a chat message. AI Agent Governance uses it to preserve accountability. SoloCrew is the product proof surface where confirmation boundaries matter as part of an operating loop.",
    evidenceRoute:
      "The evidence route for Confirmation Boundary starts with the lifecycle governance essay, where confirmation is treated as a protocol primitive rather than a decorative checkpoint. SoloCrew is the most concrete product route because confirmation boundaries have to feel usable inside a working loop. MPLP provides the protocol vocabulary, and Validation Lab asks whether the resulting approval record is enough for later review. The boundary should explain the approved plan, the excluded scope, the expected evidence, and the return condition before the agent continues. That makes approval durable enough to audit rather than merely visible in a UI at execution time.",

    definition:

For AI agent systems, that means representing intent, context, roles, plans, confirmations, traces, evidence, learning, and accepted outcomes as more than informal language. Protocol Engineering asks what must be true before agents act and what must remain traceable after they act.",
    problem:
      "The problem it names is that agent systems often depend on implicit agreements. The human assumes the agent understood the intent. The runtime assumes permissions are enough. The orchestrator assumes the plan is valid. The log assumes history is evidence. These assumptions may hold in small demos, but they become brittle when work crosses multiple agents, vendors, tools, or review cycles.",
    whyExistingApproachesAreNotEnough:
      "Application logic can encode local rules, but those rules often stay trapped inside one application. Prompt rules can guide behavior, but they are hard to validate across systems. Observability can expose events, but it may not define their meaning.

It identifies what has to remain continuous; Protocol Engineering turns that continuity into explicit records, modules, and interfaces. MPLP is the protocol proof surface for this work.
